# Spam-Detector
Implementation of a Spam Detector for mails using NLTK
This repo contains code for a experimental spam detector using two different machine learning classifiers, naive bayes classifier and Decision tree classifier. It uses NLTK to process and train the model. The decision tree is optimal for a smaller training set as the exact match evaluations is better. The Naive Bayes Classifier works way better in terms of time and computing when training using larger training datasets.
